<img src="icon.png" alt="Refresh Launchpad Icon" width="100"/>

This Alfred Workflow sorts the first page of your Launchpad, like when you first fired up your Mac. Your remaining applications will be placed into new pages, but won't get sorted due to current limitations.

## Usage

1. [Grab the latest release](https://github.com/maxwelljordanwhite/Refresh-Launchpad/releases) (also available from [Pacmax](https://pacmax.org/pac/maxwelljordanwhite-refresh-launchpad/))
2. Open the `.alfredworkflow` file & select Import
3. Launch Alfred and type either `rl` or `refresh launchpad`
